# Life-Long Geek, Software Engineer, Learner and Gamer

## About me

I've started programming 10 years ago by learning QBasic and VB6, then because I was interested in game development I've learned C and C++.

Then started experimenting with Action Script, Lite-C (3D Game Studio), Unity 3D and some 3D modeling softwares such as Autodesk Maya and 3DS Max.

After that I've started learning Web Development using PHP and Python for back-end and HTML,CSS and JavaScript for font-end.

When I joined the College I've learned C# and .Net Framework and SQL Server and I got deep in learning those,
so I started working as a Full Stack Software Developer.

Based on what I was working on, I learned high performance software design/architecture and created many high-performance softwares using .net framework.

Also really interested in Go and currently experimenting my side projects with it, and It's my favorite language after C#.

In this ten years I've never stopped learning/playing/experimenting new technologies and languages.

Currently working as C# Developer at [Mabna DP](http://mabnadp.com).
